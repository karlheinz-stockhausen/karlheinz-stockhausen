''Agar'' is a (constructed) language spoken in Ádagyi (Transylvania), in Hungary, Romania, & Serbia, belonging to the Urgic group of the Finno-Uralic language family. 
It is the closest living language to 'a Magyar Nyelv', the Hungarian Language - they are highly mutually intelligeble.
Ill add more about the language here later

PHONOLOGY

/p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /c/, /ɟ/, /k/, /g/
/ts/, /t̠ʃ/, /d̠ʒ/
/f/, /v/, /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /h/

Every consonant besides /w/, /l/, /ʎ/, /h/, /dz/, /t̠ʃ/, /d̠ʒ/, and /ʒ/ can be geminated. The gemination is marked in the orthography
by repeating the letter. However, for letters that are digraphs or trigraphs ( /s/, /t̠ʃ/, /d̠ʒ/, /ɟ/, /ɲ/, & /ŋ/ ) are marked in the orthography
by repeating the final letter of the di/trigraph. However, specifically for /d̠ʒ/, the geminated form is marked in the orthography by switching
<dzs> to <dsz>.
