GRAMMAR
The grammar... oh god.
Let's just start with Agar's pronouns. I like pronouns, and you should too!

Agar is surprisingly regular with how to construct pronouns.

TDL im lazy lol

CASES

Oh god, the cases.

Agar has about 22 to 24 cases, depending on whom you ask. They are suffixed directly onto the noun, and changed depending on the noun's class.
If the noun is either neutral or has been blocked by a blocking consonant, the neutral affix will be affixed onto the noun instead.
